Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a
virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range,
creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

Other Notes

You can have up to five (5) nondefault Amazon VPCs per AWS account per AWS Region*.
You can have up to four (4) secondary IP ranges per Amazon VPC*.
You can create up to two hundred (200) subnets per Amazon VPC*.
You can have up to five (5) Amazon VPC Elastic IP Addresses per AWS account per AWS Region*.

Features:
1. Default VPCs are attached to Internet and all instances launched in default subnets in the default VPC automatically receive public IP addresses.

Notes:
1. A subnet must reside within a single Availability Zone.
2. Initial launch limit for amazon ec2 is 20.
3. IP addresses for any stopped instances in a subnet are considered unavailable.
4. Network interfaces can only be attached to instances residing in the same Availability Zone.
5. You can attach and detach secondary interfaces (eth1-ethn) on an EC2 instance, but you canâ€™t detach the eth0 interface.
6. Peered VPCs must have non-overlapping IP ranges.
7. VPC peering connections do not require an Internet Gateway.
8. Security groups cannot be referenced across an Inter-Region VPC Peering connection.
9. Inter-Region VPC Peering does not support IPv6.
10. EC2-Classic instance cannot be linked to more than one VPC at the same time.
11. The EC2 public DNS hostname will not resolve to the private IP address of the EC2-VPC instance when queried from an EC2-Classic instance, and vice-versa.
