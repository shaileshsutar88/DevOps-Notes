Introduction:
Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers you everything needed to build an application or website,
plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. Whether you’re new to the cloud or looking to get on the cloud quickly with AWS infrastructure.

Features:
1. Lightsail virtual servers
   Lightsail offers virtual servers (instances) that are easy to set up and backed by the power and reliability of AWS. As you’re creating your
   instance, Lightsail lets you click-to-launch a simple operating system (OS), a pre-configured application, or development stack - such as
   WordPress, Windows, Plesk, LAMP, Nginx, and more.

2. Simplified load balancing
   Lightsail’s simplified load balancing routes web traffic across your instances so that your websites and applications can accommodate
   variations in traffic, be better protected from outages, and deliver a seamless experience to your visitors. Additionally, Lightsail
   load balancers include integrated certificate management, providing free SSL/TLS certificates that can be provisioned and added to a
   load balancer in just a few clicks. You can request and manage certificates directly from the Lightsail console – and we manage renewals
   on your behalf.

3. Managed databases
   Launch a fully configured MySQL or PostgreSQL database in minutes and leave the maintenance to Lightsail. With Lightsail managed databases,
   you can easily scale your databases independently of your virtual servers.
