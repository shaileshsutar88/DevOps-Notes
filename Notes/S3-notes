Simple storage service

Features:

1. A single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size.
2. Inventory can be configured to generate reports on a daily or a weekly basis.
3. Objects can be accessed through S3 Access Points or directly through the bucket hostname.
4. S3 Object Lock feature blocks object version deletion during a customer-defined retention period.
5. To protect your data in Amazon S3, by default, users only have access to the S3 resources they create.
6. S3 Block Public Access settings override other S3 access permissions, making it easy for the account administrator to enforce a “no public access” policy.
7. S3 Access Points can be restricted to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), letting you easily firewall your S3 data within your private network.
8. AWS Service Control Policies can be used to require that any new S3 Access Point in your organization is restricted to VPC-only access.
9. Access Analyzer for S3 is used to evaluate your bucket access policies and enables you to discover and swiftly remediate buckets with potentially unintended access.
10. Amazon Macie can be used to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in Amazon S3.
11. S3 Select is an S3 feature designed to increase query performance by up to 400%, and reduce querying costs as much as 80%.
12. Amazon Athena queries your data in Amazon S3 without needing to extract and load it into a separate service or platform.
13. Amazon Redshift Spectrum also runs SQL queries directly against data at rest in Amazon S3, and is more appropriate for complex queries and large data sets.
14. Since Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift share a common data catalog and data formats, you can use them both against the same data sets in Amazon S3.
15. S3 Transfer Acceleration is designed to maximize transfer speeds to S3 buckets over long distances.
16. AWS Storage Gateway can be used to enable a cloud storage architecture for on-prem applications to seamlessly connect on-premises environments to Amazon S3.
17. AWS DataSync can be used to automate transferring data between on-premises storage and AWS which can transfer data at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools.
18. AWS Transfer for SFTP can be used to transfer files directly into and out of Amazon S3 using the Secure File Transfer Protocol.
