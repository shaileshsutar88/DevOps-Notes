Features:

1. Automatically scale in and out
   Launch new Amazon EC2 instances seamlessly and automatically when demand increases, and terminate unneeded Amazon EC2 instances automatically
   and save money when demand subsides.

2. Choose when and how to scale
   Scale dynamically based on your Amazon CloudWatch metrics, or predictably according to a schedule that you define. Receive notifications via
   Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to be alerted when you use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to initiate Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions,
   or when EC2 Auto Scaling completes an action.

3. Fleet management
    Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will automatically replace unhealthy or unreachable instances to maintain higher availability of your applications.
    To automate fleet management for EC2 instances, EC2 Auto Scaling monitors the health of running instances, automatically replaces impaired
    instances, and balances capacity across Availability Zones.

4. Predictive Scaling
   Predictive Scalingâ€™s machine learning algorithms detect changes in daily and weekly patterns, automatically adjusting their forecasts.
   This removes the need for manual adjustment of Auto Scaling parameters over time, making Auto Scaling simpler to configure and consume.


AWS autoscaling

Is used to manage scaling for multiple resources across multiple services.
Lets you define dynamic scaling policies for multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups or other resources using predefined scaling strategies.
Should also be used to create predictive scaling for EC2 resources.
Should be used to configure scaling policies for all of the scalable resources in your application is faster than managing scaling
policies for each resource via its individual service console.


EC2 Autoscaling

Should be used only when you to need to scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
Should be used when you need to set up scheduled or step scaling policies.
