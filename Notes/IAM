Identity and Access Management
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage
AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no
additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.

Features:
1. Enhanced security
   IAM enables security best practices by allowing you to grant unique security credentials to users and groups to specify which AWS service APIs and
   resources they can access. IAM is secure by default; users have no access to AWS resources until permissions are explicitly granted.

2. Granular control
   IAM provides the granularity to control a userâ€™s access to specific AWS services and resources using permissions. For example, terminating EC2
   instances or reading the contents of an Amazon S3 bucket.

3. Temporary credentials
   In addition to defining access permissions directly to users and groups, IAM lets you create roles. Roles allow you to define a set of permissions
   and then let authenticated users or EC2 instances assume them, increasing your security posture by granting temporary access to the resources you
   define.

4. Analyze Access
   IAM helps you analyze access across your AWS environment. Your security teams and administrators can use IAM Access Analyzer to identify resources
   that can be accessed from outside an AWS account.

5. Flexible security credential management
   IAM allows you to authenticate users in several ways, depending on how they want to use AWS services. You can assign a range of security
   credentials including passwords, key pairs, and X.509 certificates. You can also enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on users who access
   the AWS Management Console or use APIs.

6. Leverage external identity systems
   You can use IAM to grant your employees and applications access to the AWS Management Console and to AWS service APIs, using your existing identity
   systems. AWS supports federation from corporate systems like Microsoft Active Directory as well as standards-based identity providers.

7. Seamlessly integrated into AWS services
   IAM is integrated into most AWS services. This provides the ability to define access controls from one place in the AWS Management Console that
   will take effect throughout your AWS environment.
