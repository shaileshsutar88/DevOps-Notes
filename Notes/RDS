RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides
cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching
and backups.


Features:
1. Lower administrative burden
   Amazon RDS database instances are pre-configured with parameters and settings appropriate for the engine and class you have selected. You can
   launch a database instance and connect your application within minutes. DB Parameter Groups provide granular control and fine-tuning of your
   database.

2. Automatic software patching
   Amazon RDS will make sure that the relational database software powering your deployment stays up-to-date with the latest patches. You can
   exert optional control over when and if your database instance is patched.

3. Best practice recommendations
   Amazon RDS provide best practice guidance by analyzing configuration and usage metrics from your database instances. Recommendations cover areas
   such as database engine versions, storage, instance types, and networking. You can browse the available recommendations and perform a recommended
   action immediately, schedule it for their next maintenance window, or dismiss it entirely.

4. Performance
   General Purpose Storage is an SSD-backed storage option delivers a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS per provisioned GB and provides the ability to
   burst up to 3,000 IOPS above the baseline. This storage type is suitable for a broad range of database workloads.

   Provisioned IOPS Storage is an SSD-backed storage option designed to deliver fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance. You specify an
   IOPS rate when creating a database instance, and Amazon RDS provisions that IOPS rate for the lifetime of the database instance. This storage type
   is optimized for I/O-intensive transactional (OLTP) database workloads. You can provision up to 40,000 IOPS per database instance.

5. Scalability
   a. Push-button compute scaling
      You can scale the compute and memory resources powering your deployment up or down, up to a maximum of 32 vCPUs and 244 GiB of RAM.
      Compute scaling operations typically complete in a few minutes.

   b. Easy storage scaling
      As your storage requirements grow, you can also provision additional storage. The Amazon Aurora engine will automatically grow the size of your
      database volume as your database storage needs grow, up to a maximum of 64 TB or a maximum you define. The MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and
      PostgreSQL engines allow you to scale up to 64 TB of storage and SQL Server supports up to 16 TB. Storage scaling is on-the-fly with zero
      downtime.

   c. Read Replicas
      Read Replicas make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.
      You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your
      data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput.

6. Availability and durability
   a. Automated backups
      The automated backup feature of Amazon RDS enables point-in-time recovery for your database instance. Amazon RDS will backup your database and
      transaction logs and store both for a user-specified retention period. Your automatic backup retention period can be configured to up to
      thirty-five days.

   b. Database snapshots
      Database snapshots are user-initiated backups of your instance stored in Amazon S3 that are kept until you explicitly delete them. You can
      create a new instance from a database snapshots whenever you desire. Although database snapshots serve operationally as full backups, you are
      billed only for incremental storage use.

   c. Multi-AZ deployments
      Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for database instances, making them a natural fit for production
      database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ database instance, Amazon RDS synchronously replicates your data to a standby instance in a
      different Availability Zone (AZ).
